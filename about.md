Oh, Hi there! I'm Aljohn "Aj" De Guzman. I'm a Software Engineer by profession and an active runner/marathoner currently living in the Philippines.

<br>
This site is all about my talks, software development, running marathons/ultramarathons, trail runnings and other outdoor activities. I'll be sharing all my thoughts, pieces of advice and works here.
